## ðŸ“ˆ GitHub Contributions

I started actively using GitHub to commit my code when I joined OCBC Indonesia in July 2020. Before then, in my previous company, I used Bitbucket. In August 2022, our company decided to move to GitLab Enterprise. 

So, if you look at my current year contributions on GitHub, you might only see a few contributions, mostly from my personal/learning projects during my free time. The majority of my professional contributions can be seen from 2020-2022.
